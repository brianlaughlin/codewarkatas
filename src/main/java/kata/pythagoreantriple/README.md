Given an array of 3 integers a, b and c, determine if they form a pythagorean triple.

A pythagorean triple is formed when:

c2 = a2 + b2
where c is the largest value of a, b, c.

For example: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 forms a pythagorean triple, because 52 = 32 + 42

Return Values
1 if a, b and c form a pythagorean triple
0 if a, b and c do not form a pythagorean triple
For Python: return True or False
